Around the world many students leave their higher education early each year. This impairs their social 
and economic development , lowers the nation's literacy rate, fosters a non-innovative atmosphere.In the 
world the topic of dropout is significant and intriguing.
            
According to a poll a dropout is defined as a ever-enrolled person who has never finished
the final level of education for which they have registered and is not currently enrolled in any 
educational setting.

effectiveness. Dropout rates are viewed as a huge waste of the educational system's limited resources
